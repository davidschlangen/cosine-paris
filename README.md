# Concepts, Composition, and Conversational Coordination

Material for the "Concepts, Composition, and Conversational Coordination" Lecture Series, Paris 2019.

This repository collects the slides (and other material) for my 2019 Paris lectures. References to the cited literature in the slides. [Videos of the lectures](http://www.labex-efl.com/wordpress/2019/11/14/conference-video-david-schlangen-concepts-composition-and-conversational-coordination-semantic-competence-for-situated-interaction/) are now online.

The corpus examples can be found in the ["Semantics with Pictures"](https://github.com/clp-research/sempix) repository. The code for preprocessing the corpora in the [`clp-vision`](https://github.com/clp-research/clp-vision) repository. It assumes that you have downloaded all the original corpora, which is a lot of stuff and takes a lot of effort. If you want to try out these things, you can get access from me to a JupyterHub installation in an environment where all this data and preprocessing results are available.
